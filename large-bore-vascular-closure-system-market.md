<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Large Bore Vascular Closure System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Closure Devices</li><li>Passive Closure Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Large Bore Vascular Closure System market is primarily segmented into two types: active closure devices and passive closure devices. Active closure devices employ mechanisms that actively seal the vascular access site, often using sutures or clips, providing immediate hemostasis and reducing bleeding risks. In contrast, passive closure devices rely on natural biological processes or gravity to promote clot formation, allowing the body to manage closure over time. Both types cater to varying patient needs and procedures in vascular interventions.</p></p>
